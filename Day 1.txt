Day -1 Task
Question 1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Answer 
•	Performance: HTTP/2 is designed to be faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. It achieves this by using a technique called multiplexing,
        which allows multiple requests to be sent over a single connection, reducing the number of round trips required to load a web page.
•	Compression: HTTP/2 supports header compression, which reduces the size of header information sent between the server and client, 
        resulting in faster communication.
•	Security: HTTP/2 requires the use of encryption, which helps to ensure that data is transmitted securely over the network. 
        While HTTP/1.1 also supports encryption through HTTPS, it is not a requirement.


Question 2. Write a blog about the objects and its internal representation in javascript

•	Objects in programming can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures

•       each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-type
JavaScript Object representation:

let school = {
name : “Shyamdharan”,
location : “Erode”,
DateOfBirth : “1997”
}

•      In the above example “name”, “location”, “DateOfBirth” are all “keys” and “shyamdharan”, “Erode” and "1997" are values of these keys respectively.

       Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object.
